# 🛠️ Performance Problems with Large Data Sets in User Engagement Page

_User engagement page experiences performance degradation with large user data sets due to inefficient data processing and rendering_

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

The user engagement page (`UserEngagementPage.tsx`) suffers from performance issues when processing and displaying large user data sets. The page uses inefficient data transformation techniques and renders all data at once without pagination or virtualization.

- **Subsystem / Component:** User engagement data processing and rendering
- **Environment:** All environments with large user populations
- **Error Logs / Stack Trace:** UI freezing and slow response times with large datasets

---

## ⚠️ Root Cause Hypothesis

Several performance issues contribute to the problem:
1. Expensive data transformations on every render in `DataTable.tsx`
2. Random data generation in `processUserEngagementData` function
3. Lack of pagination or virtualization for large datasets
4. Inefficient re-rendering of components

---

## 📍 Scope & Location

- **Code Location:** 
  - `src/pages/user-engagement/components/data-table.tsx`
  - `src/pages/user-engagement/components/filter-section.tsx`
- **Configuration / Dependencies:** `mantine-react-table` for data display
- **Infrastructure:** Client-side React application

---

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the user engagement page
2. Select a user group with a large number of users (1000+)
3. Observe UI freezing and slow response times
4. Notice performance degradation as data loads

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Application should maintain responsive UI even with large datasets through proper pagination, virtualization, and efficient data processing.

---

## ❌ Actual Behavior

Application becomes unresponsive and slow when processing large user datasets, leading to poor user experience.

---

## 📊 Impact Assessment

- **Severity:** High
- **Affected Users:** Users working with large organizations or user groups
- **Business Risk:** Poor user experience, potential loss of productivity
- **Blast Radius:** User engagement tracking feature

---

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

1. Implement pagination or virtualization for large datasets
2. Optimize data transformation functions to run only when necessary
3. Remove random data generation in production code
4. Implement proper memoization for expensive computations
5. Add loading indicators for better user feedback

Example fixes:
```typescript
// In FilterSection.tsx:
// Replace random data generation with actual data processing
const loginPastMonth = lastLoginDate ? calculateActualLoginCount(/* params */) : 0;

// Add pagination to data-table.tsx:
table.setPagination({ pageIndex: 0, pageSize: 50 });
```

---

## 🎯 Rationale for Solution

These optimizations will significantly improve performance with large datasets while maintaining functionality. Virtualization is particularly important for maintaining responsive UI with large tables.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] UI remains responsive with datasets of 1000+ users
- [ ] Data processing functions optimized for performance
- [ ] Pagination or virtualization implemented for large datasets
- [ ] Performance tests with large datasets pass
