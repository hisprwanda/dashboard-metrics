# 🛠️ Missing Error Handling in Authentication Context

_Authentication context lacks proper error handling, leading to silent failures and poor user experience_

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

The authentication context (`AuthContext.tsx`) doesn't properly handle API errors or loading states, potentially causing silent failures and undefined behavior when user data cannot be fetched.

- **Subsystem / Component:** Authentication context and user data fetching
- **Environment:** All application environments
- **Error Logs / Stack Trace:** Silent failures when user authorities cannot be fetched

---

## ⚠️ Root Cause Hypothesis

The `AuthProvider` component in `AuthContext.tsx` fetches user data but doesn't properly handle error or loading states. Error and loading UI components are commented out, and there's no mechanism to notify the application of authentication failures.

---

## 📍 Scope & Location

- **Code Location:** `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 25-50)
- **Configuration / Dependencies:** `@dhis2/app-runtime` for data fetching
- **Infrastructure:** Client-side React application

---

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

1. Start the application with invalid credentials or when DHIS2 API is unavailable
2. Authentication context attempts to fetch user data
3. API returns error or fails to respond
4. Application continues without proper error handling

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Application should display appropriate error messages when authentication fails and provide mechanisms for users to retry or handle authentication errors.

---

## ❌ Actual Behavior

Application silently fails when authentication data cannot be fetched, potentially leading to undefined behavior in components that depend on user authorities.

---

## 📊 Impact Assessment

- **Severity:** High
- **Affected Users:** All users when authentication fails
- **Business Risk:** Poor user experience, difficult troubleshooting
- **Blast Radius:** Entire application's authorization-dependent features

---

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

1. Uncomment and implement proper loading and error states in `AuthProvider`
2. Add error boundary or retry mechanism for failed authentication requests
3. Provide clear error messages to users when authentication fails
4. Implement proper fallback behavior for components depending on user authorities

Example fix:
```typescript
// In AuthProvider:
if (loading) return <div>Loading user data...</div>;
if (error) return <div>Error loading user authorities: {error.message}</div>;
```

---

## 🎯 Rationale for Solution

Proper error handling improves user experience and makes troubleshooting easier. It follows React best practices for data fetching and error management.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading state properly displayed during authentication
- [ ] Error messages shown when authentication fails
- [ ] Unit tests for error and loading states
- [ ] Integration tests for authentication flow
