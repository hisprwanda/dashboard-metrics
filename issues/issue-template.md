# 🛠️ Title

_A short, precise summary of the issue. Should capture the technical nature clearly._

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Describe the core problem in technical terms.

- **Subsystem / Component:**
- **Environment:** (OS, runtime, build version, deployment target)
- **Error Logs / Stack Trace:** (attach logs or link to log file)

---

## ⚠️ Root Cause Hypothesis

What you currently suspect is causing the issue (if known).

- Could include architecture diagrams or links to code locations.

---

## 📍 Scope & Location

- **Code Location:** (file paths, functions, classes, or endpoints involved)
- **Configuration / Dependencies:** (relevant configs, library versions)
- **Infrastructure:** (environment: staging, production, container image, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

Provide a reproducible scenario:

1. Exact commands, API calls, or UI flows
2. Input data / payload examples (sanitized)
3. Expected system state before reproduction

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Describe the _correct_ or intended outcome in precise terms  
(e.g., HTTP status codes, latency, memory footprint).

---

## ❌ Actual Behavior

Describe what actually happens, including all observed side effects.  
Attach screenshots, logs, metrics, traces if possible.

---

## 📊 Impact Assessment

- **Severity:** (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- **Affected Users:** (specific user groups, services, or % of requests)
- **Business Risk:** (downtime, data corruption, security risk, etc.)
- **Blast Radius:** (cross-service effects)

---

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

Provide a **detailed** technical remediation plan:

- Design changes, config adjustments, or code modifications
- Rollback / mitigation strategy if needed
- Performance impact or new risks

---

## 🎯 Rationale for Solution

Why this approach is technically sound — mention trade-offs, rejected alternatives, and future-proofing considerations.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Checklist to verify resolution:

- [ ] Automated tests updated / created
- [ ] CI/CD passes
- [ ] Performance regression tested
- [ ] Monitoring added or verified in production
