# 🛠️ Security Vulnerability with Client-Side Password Encryption

_Client-side password encryption using hardcoded secret key creates serious security vulnerability_

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

The application uses client-side AES encryption with a hardcoded secret key to "encrypt" passwords, which provides no real security and creates a serious vulnerability. The secret key is visible in client-side code, making any "encrypted" data easily decryptable.

- **Subsystem / Component:** Credential storage and encryption utilities
- **Environment:** All client environments
- **Error Logs / Stack Trace:** N/A (security vulnerability)

---

## ⚠️ Root Cause Hypothesis

The `encryptCredentials` and `decryptCredentials` functions in `src/lib/utils.ts` use a hardcoded secret key that is visible in client-side JavaScript. This approach provides no security as the key can be easily extracted by anyone viewing the source code.

---

## 📍 Scope & Location

- **Code Location:** `src/lib/utils.ts` (lines 25-35)
- **Configuration / Dependencies:** `crypto-js` library for encryption
- **Infrastructure:** Client-side React application

---

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the application in a browser
2. View page source or use developer tools
3. Locate the JavaScript bundle
4. Search for the secret key "my-secret-key"
5. Decrypt any "encrypted" data using the key

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Sensitive data like passwords should never be stored client-side, or if absolutely necessary, should be properly encrypted using server-side mechanisms with keys that are not accessible to clients.

---

## ❌ Actual Behavior

Passwords are "encrypted" with a hardcoded key that's visible in client-side code, providing no real security.

---

## 📊 Impact Assessment

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Affected Users:** All users whose credentials are stored
- **Business Risk:** Serious security vulnerability, potential data breach
- **Blast Radius:** Any feature using client-side credential storage

---

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

1. Remove client-side password storage and encryption entirely
2. If credential storage is absolutely necessary, implement proper server-side encryption
3. Use secure authentication mechanisms like OAuth or session tokens
4. Implement proper credential management using browser's secure storage APIs if needed

Example fix:
```typescript
// Remove these functions entirely:
// export const encryptCredentials = (password: string) => { ... }
// export const decryptCredentials = (encryptedPassword: string) => { ... }
```

---

## 🎯 Rationale for Solution

Storing passwords client-side is a security anti-pattern. Proper authentication should rely on secure tokens and server-side session management. Removing this functionality eliminates the vulnerability entirely.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Client-side password encryption functions removed
- [ ] No passwords stored in client-side storage
- [ ] Security audit passes
- [ ] Proper authentication mechanisms implemented
